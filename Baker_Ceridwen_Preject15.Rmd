From Exercise 15.9 in the texbook, there is a paper about women’s and men’s eating behavior following exposure to ideal-body images and tests. The csv file has the data of men, who were given one of these four treatments
1. Viewed slides of fit, muscular men.

2. Viewed slides of fit, muscular men accompanied by diet and fitness-related text.

3. Viewed slides of fit, muscular men accompanied by text not related to diet and fitness.

4. Did not view any slides.

The data itself refers to how many pretzels the man ate after his treatment.
Contruct a multiple group boxplot. Then perform and interpret an ANOVA test, and if necessary, Tukey’s Multiple Comparisons Test.
